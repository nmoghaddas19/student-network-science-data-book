    "## What is graph distance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are complex, high dimensional objects. However sometimes we just want to ask something like: '_How similar are these two graphs?_'. Graph distances refer to a host of methods which attempt to answer this question by devising some function which takes two graphs as inputs and returns a single number representing how similar or different they are. In other words, given $G_1$ and $G_2$, we seek a function $f$ such that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(G_1, G_2) = d$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where d is the distance between the two graphs. Of course, in the process of reducing a graph to a single number, information is going to be lost, no matter how ingenious your graph distance function is. Many, many graph distance measures have been proposed which each claim their own strangths.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two broad categories of problems when it comes to comparing graphs. Firstly, we may want to compare graphs where the each node in $G_1$ maps on to a node in $G_2$ (**Known Node Correspondence**). For example we may be interested in different types of social interaction that occur between the same set of people, or how the flight patterns between the same set of airports changes over time. Secondly, we may be interested in comparing graphs where there isn't a precise mapping of nodes between the two graphs (**Unknown Node Correspondence**). For example if we wanted to know how similar are the commuting patterns between Boston and San Diego. Or we may be interested in comparing graphs of different sizes. There are different measures for tackling each of these problems. In general, measures for comparing graphs of unknown node correspondence can also be used for graphs with known node correspondence but not vice versa.\n",
