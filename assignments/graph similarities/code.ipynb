    "1. Your understanding of a topic not covered in class\n",
    "2. Your accuracy in creating *correct* code around your topic, along with a strong reference list\n",
    "3. Your ability to convey your understanding via:\n",
    "    - A) Chunking the information into a single lesson that builds on itself (e.g. breaking down complex functions into parts, putting the pieces together, using different examples to illustrate your methods)\n",
    "    - B) Good examples / visuals / writeups of what results produced during the lesson / datasets used to illustrate your concept\n",
    "    - C) At least one interactive component (i.e., the \"Your Turn!\" in our lessons)\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like in our lessons, it's okay to include more than you imagine covering in a (hypothetical) 90 minute class period. Be sure to indicate what sections of your chapter are \"advanced topics\", and always include relevant citations or motivation."
